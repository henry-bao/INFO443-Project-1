# Goal Husky!

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

  

The site can be viewed at <https://goal-husky.web.app/>

  

## Project Description

This is a React.js web application that aims to help studnets find and keep track of everyday goals with each other during the quarantine period.

  

Goal Husky is a website that aims to help UW students **find like-minded people** to achieve their same goal. And this project is a continuous project from project-1 contributed by Henry Bao and Johnny He.

## Architecture Assessment

TODO:
* Whcih **single sizeable element** are we analyzing?

For any of the following, 1) identify approximate location -- which function is it in, 2) give a short 1-sentence explanation of what the problem is  -- this could be a list or table
* Code Smells
* Documentation/Readability Concerns
* Standards Violations (syntax standards like HTML specification for React apps)
* Design Quality Deficiencies
  
  

## Unit Tests

TODO: 
* Fix Unit Tests -- ask TA or Joel if we need to cover the App.js
* A written discussion of what aspects of your code you choose to *test* and *why* -- could be a list or a table
* Documentation of test coverage and tests passing -- screenshot

### Running Unit Tests
The unit test is built using the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) tester. In order to run the test please enter the following lines into your terminal

```bash

# Install all the necessary packages

npm install

  

# Run the test

npm run test

```

  
 ## Refactoring

TODO:
* Fix **all** identified problems in the chosen element
* A description of how you fixed the problem in a few words (with names in *Fowler's Refactoring Catalogue*) -- could combine this part with the **code smell** table.
